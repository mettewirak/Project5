Coursework in FYS4150 - Computational Physics at the University of Oslo.

We've here using Monte Carlo to model financial transactions, including several parameters to approximate a realistic financial system.

Some of the scripts used for plotting the results are given in the folder "Python-scripts". However, not all, as they were mostly very similar. The main.cpp-file is used to get the statistical error of a simulation that is run.

In the branch "using_mpi" a second version of the code is avaliable. It does exactly the same as the "master"-version, only faster. The pro-files included are adapted for the stationary computers available for us students. Also remember to use the correct run-settings when using mpi.
